                    After Giving 1,000 Interviews, I've Found List of Questions That Matter | Hiring for culture fit can seem like a mystery, but this list of interview questions will help you get it right every time.
                </h5>

            <div>
                <h5>
                    How did the culture at your last company empower or disempower you?
                </h5>       
                <p>
                    This is a really interesting question because it will get candidates talking about their previous company through the lens of how they were affected by the company’s culture. Getting candidates to talk about their past employer can be very telling. Do they openly throw the company under the bus? Do they recognize the positives even though it ultimately didn’t work out? <br />
                    <br />
                    Asking specifically about the culture of their last company also tells you a lot about how they view the importance of culture. Their response will tell you if they’ve thought a lot about company culture or if they don’t really know what it is. The question will also reveal how they think they are empowered or disempowered, which will give you a look into their motivations.

                    What were the characteristics of the best boss you’ve ever had?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    I like this question as a follow-up to the culture question because it’s somewhat similar but from a different angle. If you didn’t get a sense for a candidate’s view on culture and what motivates him or her, you likely will from this question.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Did the candidate thrive under a boss who was extremely direct and valued performance above all else? Did he or she thrive under a boss that put as much emphasis on communication and interpersonal skills as results within the role?

                    Describe how you handled a conflict with one of your co-workers
                </h5>
                <p>
                    It’s always helpful to ask candidates about how they dealt with a conflict. As people, we tend to be more open and honest when recalling a specific event versus describing characteristics about ourselves. Understanding what the candidate perceives as a “conflict with a co-worker” will likely reveal information about the person’s level of self-awareness.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Understanding how someone dealt with a conflict will also give you insights into what he or she perceives as a reasonable and positive response to a conflict. No matter how wonderful your culture is, conflicts will arise. How your team deals with conflicts are the true test of our culture.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Understanding a candidate’s desire or hesitation to receive feedback tells you a lot about the person’s expectations. The frequency and type of feedback that is shared within a company tends to be highly correlated to culture.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Does the candidate expect feedback to be tied to core values? Does the person think feedback is only about performance in the role? Does he or she see feedback as a once-a-year HR formality or as part of a constant process of growth and improvement? More info visit – Culture Fit

                </h5>
                <p>
                    I like this job because it is process oriented. The reason I said that, once I am getting an opportunity to work on analyzing the required documents to writing test plans, test cases, testing the application, logging defects, retesting, preparing reports and finally testing in production as well. Therefore, I am involved from the very beginning to the end of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) Process. I like this another reason is I like to find defects, from my past experience, I think all QA team members are working towards the same goal which is the defect, the defect is the most important part for me as a QA Engineer. I enjoy logging defects. The more defects I find, the happier I am.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    I am a very detailed oriented person and I like the process-oriented job. The way QA process works is just the kind of work I like. For example, analyzing requirement documents, attending walk-through meetings, writing test plans, writing test cases, executing the test cases (or running the test cases) testing the application, logging defects, retesting them and so on. I think I really like the process and that’s why I chose this career.

                    My expectation from your company would be I will have more challenges and new things to learn and whatever the skills I have to contribute, hopefully, I will be able to contribute if they are in any way helpful to enhance the productivity of the company.

                    I love this job and want to progress in this sector. I want to know more about how to manage QA process, how to handle different responsibilities and so on. I am trying to grow as a company and I am trying to grow as a person. Since the next step is the QA lead, that would preferably be one I will targeting for.

                <p>
                    I am a team player. I get along with team members very well. As far as the working is concerned, I can be equally productive on a team or work alone.
                    <br />
                    (Caution: Never say, I like working alone. This could lead you to not getting a job as they are always looking for people who can get along with other people.)

                <p>
                    The best thing I like about a Manager is that the Manager should be able to coordinate with the other teams so that we can get the updated documents, for example, updated requirements documents right away. A Manager who can efficiently it distributes the work to the team, without being biased and easily accessible and protective to his team for the right cause. As far as “what I don’t like” is concerned, I don’t like a manager who keeps coming to desk 10 times a day to check my work even if it is just a regular work. Once the responsibility is given, the team member should be trusted and let his work done.

                    How do you Coordinate with the team? | How do you coordinate the work of you automated and manual testing in our team?

                <ul>
                    <li>I think that is the key to maintaining a healthy manual-vs-automation relation in testing is TEAMWORK {'&'} COMMUNICATION</li>
                    <li>I need to make sure both teams, the manual testers, and the automation engineers, are working based on the same agenda, coordinating their tasks based on the same priorities, and understanding how each player helps the other to fulfill the goals of the organization.  
                        <br />
                        In simple terms, how they work together in order to make their testing process faster, broader and eventually more effective.</li>
                    <li>Make sure they are coordinated, by having regular update meetings and making sure there is active participation of both teams when planning the testing tasks for each project.</li>
                    <li>Have both teams work in an integrated environment where both manual and automated tests are managed and executed.  This will allow all testers, and also every other person in the company, to see the “full picture” and understand both on a planning and execution level what is been covered, what has been tested, and what are the results of these tests.  After all, no one really cares if the test was run manually or automatically, they care about the results of the test.</li>
                    <li>Have a process in place where automation is a tool to help a manual testing team.</li>
                    <li>The correct process is what will eventually make or break the relationship between manual and automatic tests.  Both teams need to understand that the idea of automation is to free the time of manual testers to run the more complex tests, those that are hard or expensive to automate.  Once they understand that they complement each other and not compete with one-another they will be able to focus on their shared challenges instead of their rivalries.</li>
                    <li>In short, I need to make sure my teams have both the agenda as well as the infrastructure required in order to coordinate their work.</li>
                    <li>In the end, it is the work of the Manager/Lead and the Organization to create the environment and the “team norms ground rules” that will allow all members to feel like they provide their work and help drive the project forward TOGETHER.</li>
