                Return on Investment (ROI) for KIDS

            <p>
                I am paying my KIDS $20-30/hour to CODE and some people are thinking this is a STUPID {'&'} DUMB IDEA! but, I would like to say this a GENIUS IDEA because here is MATH & REALITY! 
                I am not buying a car for my KIDS at the age of 16 including insurance, on average the age of 16th the first CAR is about $15K & Insurance for $6K Total is $21K.
                Compare to over a period of 5 years, I will end up paying one kid $10K to CODE.
                I'm not "BUYING THE CAR" but they are EARNING the CAR with the SKILL set. I don't make them do this. If they want to earn it, they can. If they don't, they don't still, they can continue education to the next level & get a faster way to complete graduation!
